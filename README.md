## What is Trans*Code?

Trans*Code is a hackday series that brings trans folk and allies together to build community and explore technological solutions to trans related issues.


The goals of Trans*Code are:

- build community. We want to help trans folk meet and forge connections with other trans folk and with allies.

- educate. We want to help trans people learn more about technology and the ways it may improve their lives.

- create and code. We hope that participants explore ideas and technologies, and create code that they can be proud of.

To achieve those goals we invite trans folk and allies to come together for a day of hacking in a safe, friendly, and inclusive environment.


## The Basics

### What is a Trans*Code event?

A Trans*Code event is a hackday event where people come together to work on projects that relate to the trans community.

Trans*Code events are always non-profit and free for participants if at all possible. We do not pay volunteers, speakers or organisers. Attendees don't need any previous knowledge about programming. All the attendees need is some curiosity and a desire to engage with the problems.

### Philosophy

- __Attendee's experience matters__. Trans and non-binary folk rarely have the experience of being in an environment where *they* are the default group. Instead of the daily experience of feeling like an outsider, we want them to feel safe, at home, and at the center of the event.
- __Everyone can do it__. Technology is for people and everyone can be a creator. Show the bigger picture and encourage attendees to try new things. Even if someone can't code, they can contribute subject knowledge and experience.
- __It's all about the people__. People are the core of what we do. We create events that we would want to attend ourselves. Think about your attendees' experience, help them, be welcoming and make sure no one is lost. Be helpful and proactive. Smile, ask questions, make them feel awesome.
