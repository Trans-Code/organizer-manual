## The Basics

### What is a Trans*Code event?

A Trans*Code event is a one-day hackday....

Trans*Code events are always non-profit and free for participants. We do not pay coaches, speakers or organizers. Attendees don't need any previous knowledge about programming and there is no age limitation. All the attendees need is a laptop and some curiosity.

### Philosophy

- __Attendee's experience matters__. When you're learning something new, it is common to get lost or discouraged because it's hard. That's why a helpful and friendly environment matters a lot to the learning experience. Make sure attendees feel like little children in Disneyland, excited to go on an adventure. It's all in the details.
- __Everyone can do it__. Technology is for people and everyone can be a creator. Show the bigger picture and encourage attendees to try new things.
- __It's all about the people__. People are the core of what we do. We create events that we would want to attend ourselves. Think about your attendees' experience, help them, be welcoming and make sure no one is lost. Be helpful and proactive. Smile, ask questions, make them feel awesome.
