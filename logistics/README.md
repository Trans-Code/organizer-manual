# Logistics

There are several things that are important to remember when organizing a Trans*Code event. We won't try to explain everything in the smallest detail, but we will elaborate on some of most important things:

## Venue

General rule about the venue: very often, you can get a space for free. Your targets are: big coworking spaces, hackerspaces, makerspaces, universities, local companies, and startups. These are the places that may be willing to offer you space for free (especially during weekends).

The setup should allow you to sit everyone comfortably in small (3-10 people) groups. 

### Power cords

Remember that everyone will need power! Often the venue can offer you this, but if they can't, just ask attendees and coaches to bring one power cord each -- this way you will have more than enough.

### Internet

Internet is crucial, so ask your venue provider if they have tested the WiFi before. 

It is possible that the venue will claim they can handle Internet traffic, but during the workshop it turns out they can't. It's a good idea to ask if they have previously hosted programming workshops for 100+ people. 

If you don't have confidence in the network, it might also be a good idea to have some backup. You can use mobile internet to create a hotspot for attendees if internet is not working properly. Make sure to check to see if there are problems with the Internet.

## Food

Ideally, the venue for the event will also supply food. If they don't/can't you can look for other sponseIf your budget doesn't allow for this, don't worry too much. It's a free event, and people will be grateful to you anyway. Lunch is the most important meal, because you'll want to keep people energized and don't want to provide too much distraction.

But if you can, it's awesome to do this:

### Breakfast

Usually buying some pastries or donuts on the way to the venue is enough. Order coffee/tea from a catering company or buy some in the store.

### Lunch

Order something fresh and tasty. Plan for ~25% of vegetarian option (some people just prefer veggies even if they are not vegetarians). If you don't have a lot of money, buying bread and a tray of lunch meats and cheeses, plus some peanut butter, at a store so people can make themselves sandwiches is a good option. If your budget allows, remember to ask attendees about dietary restrictions so you can be inclusive in your catering choices! 

### Drinks

Buy some water, juice and lemons with paper or plastic cups before the event so you don't have to overpay the catering company for these items. Usually 1 liter per person per day is sufficient. If you don't have a car, transporting that much water might be a problem. You can ask some of you coaches or other helpers to meet you at a store the morning of the workshop and help you carry the water to the venue. In case you run out of water or food, it's good to have a helper available who can go to the store for you during the workshop.

### Snacks

Have some fresh fruit or healthy snacks (energy bars!) laying around the venue. You can buy these in the store before the event. We recommend fruit that you don't have to cut - apples, grapes, bananas, strawberries, etc. 

### Useful items

There are a few small, cheap practical items that are really useful to have:
 * Scissors, string, sticky tape / blu-tack for hanging posters, bunting etc.
 * Spare pens and paper for drawing diagrams or making notes.
 * Tissues to wipe up spills, or in case the bathrooms run out
 * Garbage bags - there will be mess to tidy up!

## Goodies

This is only if you have the budget. 

### Stickers

Pssst, [Stickermule](http://stickermule.com/) likes to sponsor events with sticker credit! You can find our [ready-to-print designs here](../resources/README.md).

### Copyrighted materials

If you found an awesome design (picture, font, drawing, etc) you would love to use during your event, **don't forget to check the license**! Only use open source materials or pay for the license. If you can't find the license of something, please don't use it.

## Marketing

### Photos & Videos

This is really nice to have, and sometimes you can get this kind of service for free if you have friends/friendly local people who want to support your initiative. Your venue might have a marketing department that could donate the time of their in-house photographer, so be sure to ask! It's a great memory to have some nice, professional photos or a video from the event. It also helps to use it as marketing material for your next event, plus you have something to show to the sponsors!

Don't forget to ask attendees and coaches if they want their picture taken. Be sure to have some way of indicatingthose who want to be in the pictures, and those who don't. One simple way is to get some sticker dots to place on the name tags - a red dot can indicate that someone does not want their picture taken.

If you have resources (money/people), then totally do it. It's worth it!
