# Attendees

The goal of Trans*Code is to help trans and non-binary people build community and bring new people into technology. __We are focused on trans and non-binary people, but cisgender allies are welcome as well__. We encourage local organisers to give priority to trans and non-binary applicants, especially when the event is under the Trans*Code name. 

While Trans\*Code is a hack day and that suggests the ability to code, the event should be open to all, regardless of ability to code. Creating software requires more than just programmers - it also takes people with knowledge of the issue being solved, the ability design, to test, etc. That means that anyone should be able to contribute to at least some of the projects at a Trans\*Code event, regardless of their technical and coding expertise.

## Attendee Registration

Typically Trans*Code events have been free, since many trans folk are unemployed or under-employed. Eventbrite has worked well for tracking registration.

## Mentor Registration

In the past it has worked well to offer about 20% of the regular attendee tickets as "mentor" tickets. Quite often cisgender allies seem to be more comfortable attending a trans themed event as "mentors" rather than participants. We encourage mentors to choose a particular group to work with, so in fact there is little practical difference between a mentor and a participant.

## Capacity and Waiting lists

You will probably have an upper limit on capacity based on the venue size. You will also need to have some limit for planning food. Since at least 10% of the registrants will not show up on the day of the event, it's usually okay to set the number of tickets at 10% over the maximum capacity. In fact, attendance rates can vary quite a bit, from about 50% on up to 80% or 90%.

It's not worth it to keep a waiting list.
