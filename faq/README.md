# FAQ: Frequently Asked Questions

Trans*Code events have been happening all over the UK and in other countries for a while now, and
we get some repeat questions. Hopefully this page will help you if part of the
planning process has you confused!

## Website and organizing

#### Help me, I'm stuck!

If you have any questions, we'd love to help you out. You can feel free to join our Google group forum and ask questions there [Google Groups](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/transcode-team) or you can email us at info@trans.tech.

### Organizing

#### What topics should be set for a Trans\*Code event?

In keeping with our philosophy, we suggest that the topics come from the people attending. In our view anything that trans/NB folk do and are interested in is fine. It's also more fun and interesting that way. 

#### What about people who don't know how to code?

If someone has the interest, not knowing how to code shouldn't be an obstacle. Trans/NB folks are likely to subject matter experts for one project or another, and they also may well have management or design skills to contribute. Everyone should be encouraged to get involved and to contribute what they can. And everyone's contribution should be respected.

#### Do you provide swag for events?

We don't provide swag. We don't have a budget, so any extras like swag have to come from sponsors or friends. 

## Attendee FAQ's

The questions below might help as a nucleus for your own FAQ page.

#### Why Should I Feel Safe at Trans*Code?

Trans*Code is organised by trans people, for trans people. We know what feeling unsafe can be like, and we will do whatever we can to ensure your safety.

Our commitment is to make you feel safe and included, and we will call out anything or anyone that puts that in jeopardy.

It follows that if you need specific accommodations or there is anything you are concerned about, please raise it with one of our other organisers and we will do whatever we can to help.

#### Do I have to know/use a particular programming language to attend?

No, not at all! Trans*Code welcomes everyone! You may use Python or any other language you like. And if you don’t know how to code, that’s not a problem! Please come along and share your ideas, skills, and experience on a project.

#### Is Trans*Code only for trans and non-binary people?

Not at all. It is centred on trans and non-binary people and their issues, something which is all too rare for us, but we’d love to have non-trans people come as well. We welcome the chance to share our experiences and make new friends.

#### What if I have an idea for a project?

Please feel free to bring any and all ideas! We’d love to have you share whatever you’ve been working on/would like to work on/just think the trans/NB folk of the world need. If you have ideas just forming, that’s great, too. Maybe sharing them with others will help them form more completely and be the basis for some shared work.

#### What if I don’t have an idea for a project?

No problem! Just come along ready to participate and dive into a project that interests you!

#### What are some things I should and should not do when interacting with trans/non-binary people?

Like everyone else trans and non-binary people want to have our lives and identities respected.

**DO**

Try your best to use the pronouns people have indicated on their badges If you make a mistake, apologize sincerely and move on, don’t dwell on it

**DON'T**

- Don’t ask what a person’s “real” name or gender is. We have all gone through a lot to get to where we are, and our name and gender is exactly what we say it is.
- Don’t go on about how hard it is to remember genders and pronouns. When I’m walking my dog and meet someone new, they usually have no problem remembering her gender after being told once. Trans folk just want the same level of courtesy.
- Don’t be too worried about making mistakes or too over the top about apologizing if you do slip up - that just ends up making things creepy for everyone. Instead, apologize sincerely and do your best to do better.

#### I’m an experienced coder and want to be an ally - should I come to Trans*Code?

Yes! We encourage people to come to Trans*Code and both share their knowledge and get to know people from different backgrounds. If you are an experienced coder, we encourage you to join a project and provide expertise and mentorship.
