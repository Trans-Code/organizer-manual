# FAQ: Frequently Asked Questions

Trans*Code events have been happening all over the UK and in other countries for a while now, and
we get some repeat questions. Hopefully this page will help you if part of the
planning process has you confused!

## Website and organizing

**Q: Help me, I'm stuck!**

A: If you have any questions, we'd love to help you out. You can feel free to join our Google group forum and ask questions there [Google Groups](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/transcode-team) or you can email us at info@trans.tech.

### Organizing

**Q: What topics should be set for a Trans\*Code event?**

A: In keeping with our philosophy, we suggest that the topics come from the people attending. In our view anything that trans/NB folk do and are interested in is fine. It's also more fun and interesting that way. 

**Q: What about people who don't know how to code?**

A: If someone has the interest, not knowing how to code shouldn't be an obstacle. Trans/NB folks are likely to subject matter experts for one project or another, and they also may well have management or design skills to contribute. Everyone should be encouraged to get involved and to contribute what they can. And everyone's contribution should be respected.

**Q: Do you provide swag for events?**

A: We don't provide swag. We don't have a budget, so any extras like swag have to come from sponsors or friends.
