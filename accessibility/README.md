# Accessibility 

We want to make all Trans*Code events as accessible as possible. Making your event accessible will help everyone, not just attendees with disabilities. This  page can be daunting because we are trying to be comprehensive, but read through  it and do your best!

Depending on your venue, you might not be able to do all of these things. But if you think about accessibility from the time you decide to organize an event, you have a better chance of not accidentally leaving groups of people out. So here are a few things to consider with respect to accessibility when organizing your event. 

### Venue 

Before you decide on a venue, try to do a walkthrough to determine which parts of the venue you'll be using, based on access. Find out what accommodations, if any, the venue provides. It might take some pressure off you, and will also give you an idea of what is not available. 

- Are there any rooms you can use as quiet/lactation rooms? Quiet rooms should be quiet and calm, so that folks can use them to escape noise and bright lights, and also comfortably use them for pumping breast milk. 
- How compliant is your venue with the Americans with Disabilities Act, or similar laws in your country? Is it braille and signage compliant? Are there accessible routes to all parts of the venue? 
- What is the temperature differential between outside and inside? Does it tend to be chilly or warm? If you know this, you can warn people to bring a sweater (or not 
wear heavy clothes).
- Is the floor carpeted? Is the carpet firm? How easy would it be to move a wheelchair or walker across the floor?
- If the floor isn't carpeted, is it slippery? 
- Is the venue noisy or echo-y? If your venue is a hotel, will there be music in the lobby? Will your attendees be able to work in quiet? 
- Are service animals welcome? Are there grassy areas for them? 
- What do the entrances look like? Is the main entrance wheelchair accessible? 
- Are there ramps with handrails? 
- Are the restrooms accessible? Do they have grab bars and lowered sinks? Are there gender-neutral restrooms that are trans-inclusive? 
- Is there accessible parking? 
- Is there adequate lighting for your attendees to work? 
- Is the venue allergy-free and scent-free?  Consider creating a [scent policy](https://portland.adacamp.org/policies/#scent) and asking  attendees to not wear perfume to the event, for folks who have allergies, asthma, or are prone to migraines. 

### Blind or low vision attendees 

To welcome attendees with blind or low vision, first speak to your volunteers. Someone coaching an attendee with low vision should first and foremost be flexible. An attendee with low vision may already have a screen reader set up on their machine that they are used to, sothe installation party is a great opportunity for a coach to get to know this attendee's setup. 

Not all attendees who have low vision are blind, so make sure that any presenters giving lightning talks are using a large font on their screen. (Remember that code in particular can be hard to read 
on a PowerPoint.) Ask your presenters to prepare handouts in a large font. (If your volunteers are giving talks, ask them to give you a digital file in advance so you can make copies beforehand; ideally, volunteers shouldn't be out money to participate in your workshop!) Ask your presenters to also remember to verbally describe any images that are in their presentations. 

Make sure the web site and materials you prepare for the workshop pass the [Web AIM Contrast Checker](http://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/). Just feed in the hex code of the background color and the font color, and this free tool will let you 
know if your contrast is sufficient. 

Code in particular can be hard to see for anybody. The font tends to be small and not double-spaced, so if you're doing any demonstrations on a large screen, make sure your font is very large. Finding where to enlarge the type on the command line or in a text editor can also be hard, so have your volunteerswalk your attendees through that. It will make it easier for them to read and debug. 

### Hard of hearing or Deaf attendees

Again, working with attendees who are hard of hearing will go best with a flexible coach. Speak to your volunteers about using text-based communication (chat, whiteboard) during the tutorial for attendees who are Deaf or hard of hearing. Remind volunteers to look at their attendees when speaking to them, as there may 
be people who read lips. Also, find out if any of your attendees will be bringing interpreters; you will want to provide them with food and a space to sit!

Ask your presenters to speak slowly and clearly (sometimes people speak more quickly when they get nervous!), and remind them to either provide a script or a handout for their presentation. 

Remember that being hard of hearing doesn't always mean total hearing loss. People who are Deaf, hard of hearing, find it hard to concentrate in loud rooms, or for whom English (or whatever language your workshop is in) is not their first language can all benefit from these tips. 

### Web site and application 

Don't make your attendees ask which accommodations you're able to provide. Be up front about what you're able to do! This will encourage people who need those accommodations to attend, since they will be 
confident that they can participate in your event. Being specific with your list of accommodations will show potential attendees that you're working to create a space where access and inclusivity are priorities. You can just add these as questions in your FAQ section. 

Ask for suggestions from your volunteers and attendees on other things you might want to provide. For example, 
maybe you can find a friend to volunteer time for child care.
