# Promotion

Getting the word out about the event to find your attendees isn't difficult. To make it even easier, we present a handful of techniques that we found most effective:

### Press

One of the big aims of Trans\*Code is to help tell positive stories of trans and non-binary people in tech. Thatâ€™s why we like to engage the local press and highlight the participants and their enthusiasm. 

Write a press release (or ask us for help with that!), and prepare a list of local bloggers and journalists who write for women-focused magazines and simply send them an e-mail. Make sure you do that early enough that they still have time to write an article and print it (2-3 months ahead of the event is good enough). Also consider radio stations (both web and broadcast) that have shown an interest in LGBT issues.

If you're working with a big company as a sponsor, maybe their PR department can help?

### Facebook, Twitter, social media

Getting the word out via social media is pretty easy today. Create a Facebook page, Twitter profile or fanpage on whatever service you use in your city and ask your friends to help you spread the word. Tweet regularly and encourage people to share, and you should gather a following quickly.

If you let us know, we'll also use our main Twitter account to spread the word about your event. 

Go to the [resources chapter](../resources/README.md) to find logos, images and photos you can use on your social media profiles.

### Local universities 

Students and professors are a very active group of people who want to learn new things. Don't focus only on technical universities! Try to reach people with a different background. Here is what you can do:

1) Prepare a simple e-mail you can send to your local universities and ask them to pass the message to their students and faculty.

2) Find Facebook groups and communities of students, and post information about the workshop in those online spaces.

3) Print some posters and ask universities if you can put them up them.

### Local meetups and LGBT communities

Go to your local technical meetups and invite them over to Trans\*Code! Check out [meetup.com](http://meetup.com/) to identify your local meetups and communities. It's important as you speak to these groups to encourage the people there to pass the word to anyone they know who might be interested in Trans\*Code. Even if no one at the meetup is trans or nonbinary, quite often they know of someone and can help spread the word.

### Recommendations

In your registration form you can ask people to share the information about Trans\*Code with others who might be interested.
