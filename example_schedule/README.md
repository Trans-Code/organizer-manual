# Example schedule

For the big day, we really recommend you to let things happen at their own pace. While it's great to plan and work hard to make sure things run smoothly, worrying about schedules and control probably won't make the day any better for anyone in the long run.

So we recommend that you adopt the following philosophy (modeled on the [Unconference philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconference)) on the day:

- Whoever attends is exactly the right group of people
- Whatever happens is the perfect outcome
- Whenever it starts is the right time to start
- If people aren't enjoying what they're doing, they should try something else

## Sample Schedule

__8.30am__ Doors open, checkin, coffee, maybe light breakfast, socializing, **AND** suggestions for project ideas are written on a board or pad.

__9am__ Welcome everyone, do a short presentation on code of conduct, how the day will work, etc.

__9.10am__ People who suggested projects give a 2-3 minute explanation of what they want to do.

__9.40am__ People split up to start working with the project they find most interesting.

__12.30pm__ Time for lunch :) You can also fit some talks by sponsors / invited speakers here. 

__1.30pm__ Back to work.

__5.30pm__ Work stops. Everyone gathers to present what they've been working on.

__6.30pm__ End.

This is very much only a suggestion/example. The times you start and end are very dependent on your venue, the number of participants, etc.
