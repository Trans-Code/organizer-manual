# Environment

The goal of Trans*Code is not only to teach people about programming, but to __do it in a safe, positive, and trans centered environment.__

Trans*Code events are inclusive, friendly and safe environments. Everyone is welcomed, just as they are with no judgements based on sex, sexuality, gender, or gender identity and expression.


## Code of Conduct

Each event has to follow and enforce our [Code of Conduct](http://trans.tech/code-of-conduct/). The CoC is a set of rules that aim to provide inclusive environment for people of different genders, colors, religion or else.

Unacceptable behavior from any community member, including sponsors and those with decision-making authority, should not be tolerated.

You, as an organizer, have the right to take any action you deem appropriate, including a warning, temporary ban or permanent expulsion from the community.
