# Environment

The goal of Trans*Code is both to teach people about programming, but also to __do it in a safe, positive, and trans centered environment.__

Trans*Code events are inclusive, friendly and safe environments. Everyone is welcome just as they are with no judgements based on sex, sexuality, gender, or gender identity and expression.


## Code of Conduct

Each event has to follow and enforce our [Code of Conduct](../code_of_conduct/). The CoC is a set of rules intended to provide a safe and inclusive environment for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity, colour, religion, or anything else.

Unacceptable behavior should not be tolerated from any community members, including sponsors and organisers.

You, as an organiser, have the right to take any action you deem appropriate. That can include a warning, temporary ban or permanent expulsion from the community.
